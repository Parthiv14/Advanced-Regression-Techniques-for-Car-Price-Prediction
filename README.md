# Advanced Regression Techniques in Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This project delves into advanced regression techniques, such as stepwise selection and exhaustive search, to enhance predictive modeling accuracy. The focus is on constructing robust models for predicting car prices, showcasing the nuanced application of multiple linear regression in a real-world dataset.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights through visual and statistical analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming variables to improve model efficacy.
- **Regression Modeling**: Implementing multiple linear regression with advanced selection techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with validation sets.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Applying the final model to make predictions on unseen data.

## Usage
The notebook is structured sequentially, guiding users from data preprocessing to predictive analysis. Each section includes detailed code snippets and commentary to elucidate the steps involved.
